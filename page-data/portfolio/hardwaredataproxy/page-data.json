While the equipment was identical, there were multiple ways in which the equipment could be used that either extended or limited its capabilities. When a customer wanted to know what type of equipment they were working with, they could walk out into the lab and see. With a growing population of remote workers, customers walking out to the lab was no longer possible.</p>\n<p>We had tooling in Java that allowed users to see the type of equpiment available, but the data was hard-coded and needed to be updated by someone daily. Hello, human error! Fortunately, there was another system with an API that would allow us to get this information automatically.</p>\n<p>I created a client/server proxy in C# that allowed us to query a WCF server with various information about the equipment, then served that data to our Java tooling. Queries to the WCF server were naturally slow, so I made further optimizations to sensibly cache data and thread requests.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-7-01","path":"/portfolio/hardwaredataproxy","title":"Hardware Data Proxy","description":"Client-server application that serves as a proxy between a Java and WCF client.","tags":["C#"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
